The "as" operator is a form of casting:

   1. return bankHashtable[name] as IAccount;
   2. return (IAccount) bankHashtable[name];

The "as" operator has the advantage that if bankHashtable[name] does not return 
an account, or returns something of the wrong type, the as operator will generate 
a null reference.

If a cast fails (i.e. at run time the bank hash table returns the wrong thing) 
our program will fail with an exception.
